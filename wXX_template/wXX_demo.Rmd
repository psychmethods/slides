**Characteristics of tidy data:**

- Each variable forms a column.
- Each observation forms a row.
- Each type of observational unit forms a table.

# Data structures in R

## Two other advantages:

1. They subset more consistently: 
  - when you use square brackets to subset a tibble, 
      - you always get another tibble. 
  - With data frames, you sometimes get a vector and sometimes get a data frame.
2. They print more elegantly.

--

#### Compared to base R
+ Base R functions, (including those for data frames), 
  + try to guess what you want to do.
+ Sometimes, this "helpful" guessing  leads to unexpected outcomes, 
  + so tibbles have done away with most of that.

# Embeded R Code

.midi[
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
(df = data.frame("a" = 1:5, "b 2" = 5:1))
(ti = tibble("a" = 1:5, "b 2" = 5:1))
```
]

## Embeded R Code

```{r}
## but with tibbles it's all the same
ti = tibble(l1 = letters[1:5])
ti$l2 = letters[1:5]
class(ti$l1)
class(ti$l2)
```
