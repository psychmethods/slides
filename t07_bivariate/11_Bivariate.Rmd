# Relationships Between Variables

---

# Bivariate 
- So far, we have been analyzing summary statistics that describe aspects of a single list of numbers
- Frequently, however, we are interested in how variables behave together
    - Measuring the relationship (correlation)
    - Modeling the relationship (regression)

---

# Motivating Example: Smoking and Lung Capacity
.pull-left[
- Suppose, for example, we wanted to investigate the relationship between cigarette smoking and lung capacity
- We might ask a group of people about their smoking habits, and measure their lung capacities
]

.pull-right[

```{r smoking_table, echo=FALSE}

# Create Data Frame
smoking <- data.frame(cigarettes =c (0,5,10,15,20),
                      lung_capacity=c(45,42,33,31,29))

# Visualizing

```{r,echo=T}
plot(smoking)

---

# Or this one

.pull-left[
- A scatterplot shows the relationship between two quantitative variables that are measured on the same individuals. 
    - The values of one variable appear on the horizontal axis, 
    - and the values of the other variable appear on the vertical axis. 
    - Each individual in the data appears as the point in the plot fixed by the values of both variables for that individual.

# Or this one

.pull-left[
- Always plot the explanatory variable, 
  - if there is one, on the horizontal axis (the x-axis) of a scatterplot
- If there is no explanatory-response distinction, 
  - either variable can go on the horizontal axis.

.pull-left[

# Covariance

---

# Covariance

- Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables vary together.
- When two variables covary in opposite directions, as smoking and lung capacity do,
--

    - values tend to be on opposite sides of the group mean.  
    - That is, when smoking is above its group mean, 
    - lung capacity tends to be below its group mean.
--
- Consequently, by averaging the product of deviation scores, we can obtain a measure of how the variables vary together.

---

# Sample Covariance

- Sample covariance between X and Y is an estimate of that average (cross-) product of deviation scores in the population

$s_{x,y}=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}(x_{i}-\bar{x})(y_{i}-\bar{y})$

- A more computationally convenient formula:

$s_{x,y}=\frac{1}{n-1}(\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}x_{i}y_{i}-\frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}x_{i}\sum^{n}_{i=1}y_{i}}{n})$

- Useful fact: the variance of a variable is its covariance with itself. 

$s^{2}=s_{x,x}=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}((x_{i}-\bar{x})(x_{i}-\bar{x}))$


---

# Computing Covariance

- If we wanted to compute the covariance for smoking and lung capacity, we can save ourselves some heartache.
- Rather than finding each deviation from the mean for x and y

.midi[
```{r,echo=T}
covariance_calc=data.frame(X=smoking$cigarettes,Y=smoking$lung_capacity)

# find x_i-x_bar
covariance_calc$dx=covariance_calc$X-mean(covariance_calc$X)

# find y_i-y_bar
covariance_calc$dy=covariance_calc$Y-mean(covariance_calc$Y)
```
]

- and then finding their product

.midi[
```{r,echo=T}
#cross multiply x deviations and y deviations
covariance_calc$dxdy=covariance_calc$dy*covariance_calc$dx

# cross multi X and Y
covariance_calc$xy=covariance_calc$Y*covariance_calc$X
```
]

---

# Computing Covariance
.pull-left[
- Giving these values

```{r,echo=T}
kable(covariance_calc)
```
]
--
.pull-right[
- We'd then sum the dXdY column and get `r sum(covariance_calc$dxdy)`, and we then compute the covariance as: 

$s_{x,y}=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}(x_{i}-\bar{x})(y_{i}-\bar{y})= \frac{-215}{5-1}=-53.75$
]

---

# Alternative Computation

- We can compute $\sum x=50$, $\sum y=180$, $\sum xy=1585$, and n, and use that easier equation

$s_{x,y}=\frac{1}{n-1}(\sum x_{i}y_{i}-\frac{\sum x_{i}\sum y_{i}}{n})$

$=\frac{1}{5-1}(1585-\frac{50\times180}{5})$

$=\frac{1}{4}(1585-\frac{9000}{5})$

$=\frac{1}{4}(1585-1800)$

$=\frac{1}{4}(-215)$

$=-53.75$

---

# Covariance in R

```{r,echo=T}
cov(smoking)

cov(smoking)[1,2]

var(smoking$cigarettes)
```

---

# Covariance

- Although covariance is an *extremely* important concept and is the cornerstone of many advanced methods (ANOVA, ANCOVA, SEM, regression, etc), it has some limitations:
- it has interpretation problems just like variance
- it isn't in a meaningful scale
- it tells us whether a relationship is positive or negative
    - but not much more than that.

---

# Covariance Scaling

- Is `r cov(smoking)[1,2]` a strong relationship? 
    - It depends on the scale
- If we convert cigarettes into packs, the relationship hasn't changed.
- but the covariance has...

--

```{r,echo=T}
smoking$packs=smoking$cigarettes/20

cov(smoking$packs,smoking$lung_capacity)
```

- The value is, in a sense, "polluted by the metric of the numbers."
- Depending on the scale of the data, the absolute value of the covariance can be very large or very small

---

# Standardizing Covariance

- We can take the scale out of the covariance.
- What happens if we use z-scores instead of raw deviations?
- Remember, that z-scores are also a measure of deviations
- This is called the (Pearson) Correlation Coefficient

---

# Correlation Coefficient

- The sample correlation is the sum of cross-products of z-scores divided by n-1:

$r_{x,y}=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}(Z_{x_{i}}\times Z_{y_{i}})$

- The sample correlation is the sum of cross-products of z-scores divided by n:

$\rho_{x,y}=\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}(Z_{x_{i}}\times Z_{y_{i}})$

---

# Formulae for Correlation

- We can think of a correlation coefficient as a covariance with
the standard deviations factored out:

$r_{x,y}=\frac{s_{x,y}}{s_{x}\times s_{y}}$

- we can think of covariance as a correlation with the standard deviations put back in.

$s_{x,y}=r_{x,y}s_{x}s_{y}$

- The correlation quantifies the linear association.

- If your data aren't linear, then the correlation can be misleading.

- These data were constructed in 1973 by the statistician Francis Anscombe (1973). 
- Demonstrates the importance of graphing data before analyzing it and the effect of outliers on statistical properties. 
- It's intended to counter the impression among statisticians that "numerical calculations are exact, but graphs are rough."

---


# Correlation Cautions

- Correlation requires that both variables be quantitative, so it makes sense to do the arithmetic indicated by the formula for r𝑟.
- Correlation does not describe curved relationships between variables, no matter how strong the relationship is between them.
- Correlation is strongly affected by a few outlying observations.
- Correlation is not a complete summary of two-variable data.

---


# More Correlation Cautions

- Restriction of Range.
- Results in r to go down artificially
    - r -> $\rho$
- Combined groups can hid the relationships, when groups have different relationships
    - Simpson’s Paradox

# Simpson's Paradox

Simpson's Paradox occurs when a trend appears in different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined.

Let's explore this through two examples:
1. Extraversion and Job Performance
2. Extraversion, Education, and Salary

# Final Comments on the Correlation

- The correlation coefficient is neither robust nor resistant.
    - Not robust because strong nonlinear relationships between the two variables may not be recognized.
    - Not resistant because it is sensitive to outlying points.
    - It is the most sensitive summary stat we have seen thus far
