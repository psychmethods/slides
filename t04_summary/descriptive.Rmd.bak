# Characteristics of distributions

---

## Describing distributions with numbers 

- Hundreds of descriptive statistics
- Goal is to describe the data with a single number that represents an entire distribution
- Taxonomy
    - Central tendency / location
    - Spread
    - Skew
---

# Central tendency / location

- Central tendency aims to capture the center of the distribution.

```{r cent}

# Display the normal distributions with various means

x <- seq(-80, 80, length=1000)
hx <- dnorm(x)
colors <- c("red", "blue","green", "purple", "black")

plot(x, hx, type="l", lty=2, xlab="x value",
		 ylab="Density", main="Distributions with Different Means",xlim=c(-7, 7))
location<-c(2,4,-2,-4)
labels=paste0("Mean = ",location)
labels[length(labels)+1]="Mean = 0"

for (i in 1:length(location)){
	lines(x, dnorm(x,mean=location[i]), lwd=1, col=colors[i])
}

legend("topright", inset=.05, title="Distributions",
  labels, lwd=2, lty=c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2), col=colors)

```

# Variability/spread

- Variability describes how spread out the data are from that center
    - Low variance has a less wide distribution, with the bulk of the mass in the center
    - High variance has a very wide distribution, bulk of distribution is spread out

---

# Display the normal distributions with various standard deviations

```{r spread}

plot(x, hx, type="l", lty=2, xlab="x value",
		 ylab="Density", main="Distributions with Different Standard Deviations",xlim=c(-7, 7))
spread=c(.5,2,4)
labels=paste0("SD = ",spread)
labels[length(labels)+1]="SD = 1"
for (i in 1:length(spread)){
	lines(x, dnorm(x,sd=spread[i]), lwd=1, col=colors[i])
} 
legend("topright", inset=.05, title="Distributions",
  labels, lwd=2, lty=c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2), col=colors[c(1:3,5)])

```

# Skew/ Asymetry
- Skewness is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of symmetry. 
- A distribution, or data set, is symmetric 
    - if it looks the same to the left and right of the center point.

- Refers to the tail of the distribution
- Positively skewed (right skewed)
    - Bulk of the mass is on the left

-	Negatively skewed (left skewed)
    - Bulk of the mass is on the right
