# Measurement


---

## Roadmap

- Measurement
- Levels of measurement
- Goals of measurement


---

## Measurement

- 4th step in the research process
  - Def: assignment of numbers to characteristics of people or objects
--

- Examples: measurement scales
    - Speed $\rightarrow$ miles-per-hour
    - Temperature (kelvin)
    - Order of finishers
    - Numbers on the back of basketball jerseys
    
---

## Variables
- Variables contain the outcome of measurement processes
  - Qualitative: 
      - number represent qualities (not quantities)
  - Quantitative: 
      - numbers mean something in relation quantities in the real world
  
---

## Characterize each level of measurement   

- Levels of Measurement (Stevens, 1946)
    - Nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio
--
- Properties:
    - Have absolute zero
        - 0 indicated absence (origin means zero)
    - Equal intervals
         - An interval means the same value at any point on measurement scales
    - Order
        - Number means order
    - Identity
          - Different numbers mean different measurement outcomes (1 $\neq$ 2 )

# Levels of Measurement


---

# Ratio (quantitative)


- All four properties
    - Have absolute zero
    - Equal intervals
    - Order
    - Identity
- Multiplication and Division are permissible transformations


---

# Example (Base R)


```{r, echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE}
# loads the HistData package
library(HistData)
# loads the Galton dataset
data("Galton")
# First 3n rows of data
head(Galton, n=3)
```


---

# Example (Base R)



.pull-left[
```{r ref.label = "hist1",out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```

]
.pull-right[
```{r hist1, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE,echo = TRUE}
# Histogram
hist(Galton$child)
```
]

---

# Example (Base R)

.pull-left[
```{r ref.label = "hist2",out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r hist2, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE,echo = TRUE}
# Density Plot
plot(density(Galton$child))
```

]

---


# Bandwidth Aside

[Bandwidth: Smoothing Method](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/density.html)

```{r, echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE}
args(density.default)

#?density # Gives you documentation
```

---
# Bandwidth Aside
```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/density.png")
```

---

# Bandwidth Aside

.pull-left[
```{r ref.label = "dens",out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r dens, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE,echo = TRUE}
set.seed(201010)
x <- rnorm(1000, 10, 2)
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

#A bit bumpy
plot(density(x))
#Very sooth
plot(density(x,adjust = 10))
 #Very bumpy
plot(density(x,adjust = .1))
```

]


---

# Interval
- Interval (quantitative)
    - Temperature in Fahrenheit is an example
    - Addition is a permissible transformation
    -	Has three features (all but absolute zero)
    
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Interval Example
library(datasets)
data("nottem")
nottem[1:10] 			# First ten rows of data
```

---
.pull-left[
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Histogram
hist(nottem)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Density Plot
plot(density(nottem))
```
]

---

# Ordinal (qualitative)
.pull-left[
-	Has order and identity
- Monotonic transformations are permissible
- These variables maintain the order of the values
]

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Ordinal Example
library(ggplot2movies)
data(movies)
variable<-movies$rating
head(movies[!is.na(movies$budget),], n=5) 		# First 5 rows of data, with a non-missing budget

```
---
.pull-left[
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Histogram
hist(variable) 
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Density Plot
plot(density(variable)) 
```
]

---

# Nominal

.pull-left[
- Only has identity
- Any identity preserving transformation is permissible
]


```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Nominal Example
library(vcd)
data(Arthritis)
# First 8  rows of data
Arthritis[1:8, ]
```

---
.pull-left[
```{r ref.label = "nom",out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r nom, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE,echo = TRUE}
variable<-Arthritis$Treatment
#hist(variable) # error

barplot_fix <-
     prop.table(table(variable))
# Sometimes, R is silly
barplot(barplot_fix)
```
]
---

# More complex measurement level taxomony

- Missing (considered nominal under the Stevens taxonomy)
- Binary (considered nominal under the Stevens taxonomy)
- Nominal (considered nominal under the Stevens taxonomy)
- Partially ordered (considered ordinal under Stevens)
- Fully ordered (considered ordinal under Stevens)
- Interval
- Ratio
- Absolute measurement (has no permissible transformation)
    - $6.02$ x $10^{23}$
    - $\pi$
    
---

## Could measurement level be itself on a continuum?

.pull-left[
- Example: IQ
    - Falls between interval and ratio?
    - Or falls between ordinal and interval?

# Goals of Measurement

- Reliable
  - "…the degree to which a test or measure produces the same scores when applied in the same circumstances…" (Thomas and Nelson 1996)
  - In other words, if you take the measure again, will you get the same result?

--

- (Internal) Validity
  - "Degree to which a test or instrument measures what it purports to measure"  (Thomas and Nelson 1996)
  - In other words, does your measure measure what is it supposed to measure?

---

## More on this later...

- Two Major Areas within Validity
  - Internal Validity
    - Is this evidence supportive of our claim, within this study?
  
  - External Validity
    - Is this evidence supportive of our claim beyond this study?
    - Does this finding generalize to outside this study?
