## Step 0: Set up hypotheses


- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The mean `Sepal.Length` is equal to 5.5.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The mean `Sepal.Length` is not equal to 5.5.


---

# Step 1: Calculate the Mean

.pull-left[
1. Open the Excel file `IrisData.xlsx`.

2. Select the cell where you want to calculate the mean (e.g., cell B152).

3. Click the cell and check the Formula Bar at the top of the screen.

4. In the Formula Bar, enter the formula to calculate the mean:

   - `=AVERAGE(A2:A151)`
   
5. Press Enter to execute the formula, and the mean value will appear in the selected cell.

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
image_path <- "../img/excel_lab/excel screenshot_1.png"
img <- image_read(image_path) %>%
  image_annotate("=AVERAGE(A2:A151)", size = 30, color = "red", location = "+550+475")
img
```

**Explanation**:
- **Formula Bar**: This is where you can enter or edit formulas for the selected cell.
- **Formula Entry**: You can type any valid Excel formula here. In this case, `=AVERAGE()` calculates the sample mean.

]
---

# Step 2: Calculate the Standard Deviation

.pull-left[
1. **Select a new cell** (e.g., B153) to store the standard deviation result.
   - Click on the cell and use the **Formula Bar** to enter the formula.

2. **In the Formula Bar**, type the following formula to calculate the standard deviation of `Sepal.Length`:
   - `=STDEV.S(A2:A151)`

3. Press **Enter**, and Excel will compute the standard deviation in the selected cell.

  image_annotate("=STDEV.S(A2:A151)", size = 30, color = "blue", location = "+550+475")
img
```
]

---


# Step 3: Calculate the sample size
.pull-left[
   - Select another empty cell (e.g., B154) to store the sample size.
   - In the **Formula Bar**, type `=COUNT(A2:A151)`.
   - Press **Enter** to display the sample size in the selected cell.
]

  image_annotate("=COUNT(A2:A151)", size = 30, color = "darkgreen", location = "+550+475")

img
```
]

---

# Step 4: Calculate T-Statistic

.pull-left.midi[
0. Use the formula for a one-sample t-test:  
   $$
   t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}
   $$
1. **Select cell B155** to enter the formula.

2. In the **Formula Bar**, enter the T-score formula:
   - `=(B152 - 5.5) / (B153 / SQRT(B154))`.
   - Ensure you are referencing the correct cells:
     - `[Mean Cell]` (e.g., B152) is where the mean was calculated.
     - `[Standard Deviation Cell]` (e.g., B153) is where the standard deviation was calculated.
     - `[Sample Size Cell]` (e.g., B154) contains the sample size.

3. **Press Enter** to calculate the T-statistic, which will appear in cell B155.

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
image_path <- "../img/excel_lab/excel screenshot_zoom.png"
img <- image_read(image_path) %>%
  image_annotate("=(B152 - 5.5) / (B153 / SQRT(B154))", size = 30, color = "darkgreen", location = "+550+475")
img

```
]

---

# Step 5: Calculate the P-Value

.pull-left[
1. **Select cell B156** to display the p-value.

2. **Calculate the Two-Tailed P-Value**:
   - Go to the **Formula Bar** and type `=T.DIST.2T(ABS(B155), B154-1)`
   - This formula uses the calculated T-statistic and degrees of freedom to return the p-value.
   - Press **Enter** to see the p-value in cell B156.
.midi[
**Explanation**:
- The **p-value** represents the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as ours if the null hypothesis is true.
- In this case, a lower p-value (typically < 0.05) would indicate a statistically significant difference from the hypothesized mean of 5.5.

  image_annotate("=T.DIST.2T(ABS(T), df)", size = 30, color = "purple", location = "+550+475")
img
```
]

---

# Step 6: Interpret Results

.pull-left[

.medi[
**Explanation**:

- **T.DIST.2T()**: This function calculates the two-tailed p-value using the T-statistic and degrees of freedom.
- **Degrees of Freedom (df)**: Calculated as \( n - 1 \), where \( n \) is the sample size.


3. **Interpretation**:
   - Compare the p-value to the significance level (usually 0.05):
      - **If p < 0.05**: Reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the mean `Sepal.Length` differs significantly from 5.5.
      - **If p ≥ 0.05**: Do not reject the null hypothesis, indicating no significant difference.

img
```
]

---

# Step 5: Calculate Degrees of Freedom

.pull-left[
Degrees of freedom \( df \) for a two-sample t-test can be calculated as:

$$
df = \frac{\left(\frac{\text{SD}_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\text{SD}_2^2}{n_2}\right)^2}{\frac{\left(\frac{\text{SD}_1^2}{n_1}\right)^2}{n_1 - 1} + \frac{\left(\frac{\text{SD}_2^2}{n_2}\right)^2}{n_2 - 1}}
$$

1. **Select cell B159** and enter the formula for df:
   - `=(((B154^2 / B156) + (B155^2 / B157))^2) / (((B154^2 / B156)^2 / (B156 - 1)) + ((B155^2 / B157)^2 / (B157 - 1)))`
2. **Press Enter** to calculate the degrees of freedom in cell B159.

]

# Recap of Recaps

- In this lab, you explored various statistical concepts using Excel:
  - **One-Sample T-Test**: Testing the mean `Sepal.Length` against a hypothesized value.
  - **Two-Sample T-Test**: Comparing the means of `Sepal.Length` between `Virginica` and `Versicolor`.
  - **One-Way ANOVA**: Testing for differences in `Sepal.Length` across the three species (`Setosa`, `Versicolor`, `Virginica`).
  
- You used Excel functions and the Data Analysis Toolpak to perform these analyses and interpret the results.
