## M&M Sampling Activity

- Objective: Demonstrate sampling principles using M&M's
  - Hands-on experience with data collection and analysis
--

- Materials:
  - Small packages of plain M&M's (one per student)
  - Napkins for sorting


---

## M&M Sampling Procedure

*Steps in the activity*

- Distribute M&M packages and materials
--

- Sort M&M's by color on napkins
--

- Record frequency of each color
--

- Calculate percentages for each color
--

- Hypothesize population color distribution
--

- Form pairs to pool data
--

- Pool data for entire class
    - using google sheets (and some R magic)

---

# Advanced Sampling Concepts

## Relating to Sampling Methods

.pull-left[
- Simple random sampling
    - Each M&M package as a random sample
- Stratified sampling
    - If we sorted M&M bags by production date,
    - Could this improve representativeness?
]
--

.pull-right[

- Cluster sampling
  - If we sampled entire boxes of M&M packages
  - Potential production batch effects?

- Systematic sampling
  - If we selected every nth M&M package from production line
  - Could introduce cyclical biases?
]

---

# Potential Biases in M&M Sampling

.pull-left[
- Production process biases
    - Color distribution variations between factories
    - Akin to sampling frame bias in surveys
    
- Selection bias
  - If students choose their favorite color of package
  - Akin to  non-random sample selection in research    
  ]
  
.pull-right[

- Measurement bias
  - Errors in counting or recording M&M colors
  - Akin to survey response errors

- Non-response bias
  - If some students don't participate or eat their M&M's
  - Akin to survey non-respondents
]

---

# Importance of Representative Samples

.pull-left[
- What if we only sampled from one factory?
- Implications for psychological research
    - Generalizing from sample to population
    - External validity of research findings
    ]
    
--

.pull-right[
- Strategies for improving representativeness
  - Increasing sample size (more M&M packages)
  - Diversifying sample sources (different stores, batches)
  - Random selection procedures
  - Weighting techniques for unequal probability samples
]
---

# Wrapping Up...

.pull-left[
## Key Takeaways
1. Sampling is required for understanding populations
2. Larger samples generally provide better estimates
3. Be aware of potential biases in sampling
4. Always aim for representative samples
