# Sampling in Action: The M&M Challenge

---

## Roadmap

- M&M Sampling Activity
- Analysis and Discussion
- Advanced Sampling Concepts

---

## Sampling in Action

Sampling involves selecting a subset of a population to estimate characteristics of the whole. 

--

This session covers:

- Sample Size Effects: How different sizes influence accuracy.
- Variability in Sampling: The impact on data reliability.
- Estimation Techniques: Methods for deriving population parameters from samples.


---

## M&M Sampling Activity

- Objective: Demonstrate sampling principles using M&M's
  - Hands-on experience with data collection and analysis
  
--

- Materials:
  - Small packages of plain M&M's (one per student)
  - Napkins for sorting



---

## M&M Sampling Procedure

*Steps in the activity*

- Distribute M&M packages and materials
--

- Sort M&M's by color on napkins
--

- Record frequency of each color
--

- Calculate percentages for each color
--

- Hypothesize population color distribution
--

- Form pairs to pool data
--

- Pool data for entire class
    - using google sheets (and some R magic)

# Sample Size Effects

- Compare estimates:
    - Individual samples
    - Paired samples
    - Class-wide sample
- Discuss accuracy improvements with larger samples

---

# Example (Hypothetical data)

```{r, echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE}
# Individual sample
individual <- c(20, 15, 25, 10, 20, 10)
names(individual) <- c("Blue", "Brown", "Green", "Orange", "Red", "Yellow")

# Class-wide sample
class_wide <- c(24, 13, 16, 20, 13, 14)
names(class_wide) <- c("Blue", "Brown", "Green", "Orange", "Red", "Yellow")

# Compare
data.frame(Individual = individual, Class_Wide = class_wide)
```

---

# Visualization

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
barplot(rbind(individual, class_wide), beside = TRUE, 
        col = c("lightblue", "darkgrey"),
        legend.text = c("Individual", "Class-wide"),
        main = "M&M Color Distribution: Individual vs Class-wide")

# Advanced Sampling Concepts

---

# Relating to Sampling Methods

- Simple random sampling
    - Each M&M package as a random sample
- Stratified sampling
    - If we sorted M&M bags by production date

---

# Potential Biases

- Production process biases
    - Color distribution variations between factories
- Relating to survey sampling biases
    - Non-response bias
    - Selection bias

---

# Importance of Representative Samples

- What if we only sampled from one factory?
- Implications for psychological research
    - Generalizing from sample to population
