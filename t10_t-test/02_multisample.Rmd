## Three t-test Applications

- One sample t-test
  - Used when we want to know whether a sample we collected come from a particular population with unknown mean $\mu$. 
  - (similar to what we did with z-test so far)
--

- Matched pair t-test
  - Used when the two samples of data were related or provided by the same participants 
  - (*e.g.*, pre- and post-test)
--
  
- Independent sample t-test
  - test the difference between the means of two independent groups 
  - (*e.g.*, treatment and control group)

---

## General Procedure
.large[
1. Decide what type of test we want to use
2. Decide what the null and alternative hypothesis is.
3. List what we have
4. Compute t-statistic
5. finding critical value in t-table
6. Compare t-statistic to t* 
  - (we can also calculate p and compare to $\alpha$)
7. Make decision: reject null or not, and draw conclusion
]

## Two-sample t-tests

- Two types of two-sample t-test:
--

- Paired
  - e.g. a measurement of disease at two different parts of the body in the same patient / animal
  - e.g. measurements before and after treatment for the same individual
--

- Independent:
  - e.g.the weight of two different breeds of mice

---

## Matched pair t-test

- Used when we want to know whether a sample we collected come from a particular population with unknown mean $\mu$. 
- Important: Only used if we are interested in the difference score, and we don't make inference about pre-test measure or post-test measure
- We only use the difference score to denote change, thus a matched pair t-test is same with the one-sample t-test in terms of procedure.
- In one sample t-test, we have the sampling distribution of the mean, 
  - Here we instead have the sampling distribution of the difference score.
  - The null is that the difference score is 0
  
---

## Worked Example

- We're testing a new drug, Procardia, that's meant to reduce hypertension:
- We find 100 individuals with a high systolic blood pressure (x=  145; mmHg, SD=9 mmHg),
- We give them Procardia for a month, and then measure their blood pressure again.
- We find that the mean systolic blood pressure has decreased to 142mmHg with standard deviation 8mmHg.

.pull-left-narrow[
- Classic $R$  syntax
  - t.test(y1, y2, paired=TRUE).
  - where y1 and y2 are the paired variable of interest, and 
  - paired is set equal to true.
]

.pull-right-wide[
```{r paired, results="hide", echo=TRUE}
set.seed(282011)

preTreat <- c(rnorm(100, mean = 145, sd = 9))
postTreat <- c(rnorm(100, mean = 142, sd = 8))

t.test(preTreat, postTreat, paired = TRUE)

```

## Output

```{r ref.label = "paired", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```


---

## Paired two-sample t-test: Does the mean difference = 0?

- e.g. Research question: 
- 20 patients with ovarian cancer were studied using MRI imaging. 
  - Cellularity was measured for each patient at two sites of disease. 
- Does the cellularity differ between two different sites of disease? 

---

## Paired two-sample t-test: Does the mean difference = 0?

- Null hypothesis, $H_0$:
    + Cellularity at site A = Cellularity at site B
- Alternative hypothesis, $H_1$
    + Cellularity at site A $\ne$ Cellularity at site B
- Tails: two-tailed
- Either ***reject*** or ***do not reject*** the null hypothesis 

---

## Paired two-sample t-test; null hypothesis

- $H_0$; Cellularity at site A = Cellularity at site B
    + ***or***
- $H_0$: Cellularity at site A - Cellularity at site B = 0

## Paired two-sample t-test; key assumptions

.pull-left[
- Observations are independent
- The ***paired differences*** are normally-distributed
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
data <- read.csv("../dat/pairedtwo-samplet-test.csv")
data$diff <- data$A - data$B
ggplot(data, aes(x=diff)) + geom_histogram(fill="steelblue")
test <- t.test(data$diff)
stat <- round(test$statistic,2)
degfree <- round(test$parameter,2)
pval <- round(test$p.value,3)
critvals <- c(qt(0.05, degfree),qt(0.95,degfree))
rect1 <- data.frame(xmin = -4,xmax = critvals[1], ymin=-Inf,ymax=Inf)
rect2 <- data.frame(xmin = critvals[2],xmax = 4, ymin=-Inf,ymax=Inf)
```
]

## Paired two-sample t-test; results

.pull-left[
$t_{n-1} = t_{19} = \frac{\bar{X}_{A-B}}{s.e.(\bar{X}_{A-B})} =$ `r stat`

df = `r degfree`

P-value: `r pval`


<br>
***Reject*** $H_0$

(evidence that cellularity at Site A $\ne$ site B)
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ggplot(data.frame(x=c(-4,4)),aes(x)) + stat_function(fun=dt, args=list(df=degfree)) +
geom_rect(data=rect1,aes(xmin=xmin, xmax=xmax, ymin=ymin, ymax=ymax),fill="steelblue", alpha=0.5, inherit.aes = FALSE) + geom_rect(data=rect2,aes(xmin=xmin, xmax=xmax, ymin=ymin, ymax=ymax),fill="steelblue", alpha=0.5, inherit.aes = FALSE) + geom_vline(xintercept = stat,lty=2,col="red")
```

]


---

## Paired two-sample t-test; results

- The difference in cellularity between the two sites is 19.14 (95% CI: 8.20, 30.08).
- There is evidence of a difference in cellularity between the two sites. 
- t=`r stat`, df=`r degfree`, p=`r pval`.

# Another example


```{r onesample, results="hide", echo=TRUE}
set.seed(0)
treeVolume_t1 <- c(rnorm(75, 
                      mean = 5, 
                      sd = 5))

treeVolume_t2 = treeVolume_t1+ c(rnorm(75, 
                      mean = 0, 
                      sd = 1))

t.test(treeVolume_t1,treeVolume_t2 ) # Ho: mu = 39000

# Independent two-sample t-tests


---

## Independent two-sample t-test: Does the mean of group A = mean of group B?

![](../img/mice-breeds.png)

- e.g. research question: 40 male mice (20 of breed A and 20 of breed B) were weighed at 4 weeks old
- Does the weight of 4-week old male mice depend on breed?

---

## Independent two-sample t-test: Does the mean of group A = mean of group B?

- Null hypothesis, $H_0$
    + mean weight of breed A = mean weight of breed B
- Alternative hypothesis, $H_1$
    + mean weight of breed B $\ne$ mean weight of breed B
- Tails: two-tailed 
    + the tails on the distribution - not on the mice!!!
- Either ***reject*** or ***do not reject*** the null hypothesis

---

## Independent two-sample t-test: the data

![](../img/mice-data.png)
---

## Independent two-sample t-test: key assumptions
.pull-left[
- Observations are independent
- Observations are normally-distributed
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
mice <- read.csv("../dat/independenttwo-samplet-test.csv")
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
ggplot(mice, aes(x = Weight)) + geom_histogram(fill="steelblue",col="grey") + facet_wrap(~Breed)
```
]
---

## Independent two-sample t-test: *More* key assumptions

.pull-left[
- Equal variance in the two comparison groups
    + Use "Welch's correction" if variances are different
    + alters the t-statistic and degrees of freedom
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ggplot(mice, aes(x=Breed,y=Weight)) + geom_boxplot(fill="steelblue") + coord_flip()
test <- t.test(Weight~Breed,data=mice,var.equal = FALSE)
tsat <-round(test$statistic,2)
degfree <- round(test$parameter,2)
pval <- round(test$p.value,2)
critvals <- c(qt(0.05, degfree),qt(0.95,degfree))
rect1 <- data.frame(xmin = -4,xmax = critvals[1], ymin=-Inf,ymax=Inf)
rect2 <- data.frame(xmin = critvals[2],xmax = 4, ymin=-Inf,ymax=Inf)
```

]
---

## Independent two-sample t-test: result

.pull-left[
- $t_{df} = \frac{\bar{X_A} - \bar{X_B}}{s.e.(\bar{X_A} - \bar{X_B})}$ = `r tsat`
- df = `r degfree` (with Welch's correction)
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
ggplot(data.frame(x=c(-4,4)),aes(x)) + stat_function(fun=dt, args=list(df=degfree)) +
geom_rect(data=rect1,aes(xmin=xmin, xmax=xmax, ymin=ymin, ymax=ymax),fill="steelblue", alpha=0.5, inherit.aes = FALSE) + geom_rect(data=rect2,aes(xmin=xmin, xmax=xmax, ymin=ymin, ymax=ymax),fill="steelblue", alpha=0.5, inherit.aes = FALSE) + geom_vline(xintercept = tsat,lty=2,col="red")
```
]

P-value: `r round(test$p.value,2)`

***Do not reject*** $H_0$

(No evidence that mean weight of breed A $\ne$ mean weight of breed B)

---


## Independent two-sample t-test: result

- The difference in mean weight between the two breeds is -1.30 (95% CI: -3.48, 0.89) 
    + [NB as this is negative, breed B mice tend to be bigger than breed A].
- There is no evidence of a difference in weights between breed A and breed B. 
- t=`r tsat`, df= `r degfree` (Welch’s correction), p=`r pval`




## What if normality is not reasonable?

- Transform your data, e.g. log transformation
- Non-parametric tests....

---


## Summary - continuous variables

- One-sample t-test 
    + Use when we have one group.
- Paired two-sample t-test 
    + Use when we have two non-independent groups. 
- Independent two-sample t-test 
    + Use when we have two independent groups. A Welch correction may be needed if the two groups have different spread.
- Non-parametric tests or transformations
    + Use when we cannot assume normality. 

---

    
## Summary - t-test

- Turn scientific question to null and alternative hypothesis
- Think about test assumptions
- Calculate summary statistics
- Carry out t-test if appropriate

# Robustness of t-test...


---

## Robustness of t-test

- A confidence interval or significance test is called robust if the confidence level or p-value does not change very much when the conditions for use of the procedure are violated.
--
- Rule of thumb
--
- For one sample t-test or matched pair t-test
  - For n < 15, use t only if the data appear close to Normal or roughly symmetric. 
    - If the data are clearly skewed or if outliers are present, do not use t.
- For n> 40: The t procedures can be used, 
  - even for clearly skewed distribution
  
---
## For two independent t-test

- More robust than the one-sample t methods, particularly when the distributions are not symmetric.
- When n_{1}=n_{2} and the two population have same shape, t is robust for even very small sample. e.g., $n_{1}=n_{2}=5$. 
-Rule of thumb: adapt the guidelines for one-sample t procedures to two-sample procedures by replacing “sample size” with the “sum of the sample sizes,” $n_{1}+n_{2}$.
