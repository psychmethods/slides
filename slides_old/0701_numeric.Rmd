# Characteristics of distributions 
- Describing distributions with numbers 
    - Hundreds of descriptive statistics
    - Goal is to describe the data with a single number that represents an entire distribution
    - Taxonomy
        - Central tendency / location
        - Spread
        - Skew

# Central tendency / location

- Central tendency aims to capture the center of the distribution.


```{r cent}

# Display the normal distributions with various means

x <- seq(-80, 80, length=1000)
hx <- dnorm(x)
colors <- c("red", "blue","green", "purple", "black")

plot(x, hx, type="l", lty=2, xlab="x value",
		 ylab="Density", main="Distributions with Different Means",xlim=c(-7, 7))
location<-c(2,4,-2,-4)
labels=paste0("Mean = ",location)
labels[length(labels)+1]="Mean = 0"

for (i in 1:length(location)){
	lines(x, dnorm(x,mean=location[i]), lwd=1, col=colors[i])
}

legend("topright", inset=.05, title="Distributions",
  labels, lwd=2, lty=c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2), col=colors)

```


# Variability/spread
- Variability describes how spread out the data are from that center
    - Low variance has a less wide distribution, with the bulk of the mass in the center
    - High variance has a very wide distribution, bulk of distribution is spread out
    
```{r spread}

# Display the normal distributions with various standard deviations
plot(x, hx, type="l", lty=2, xlab="x value",
		 ylab="Density", main="Distributions with Different Standard Deviations",xlim=c(-7, 7))
spread=c(.5,2,4)
labels=paste0("SD = ",spread)
labels[length(labels)+1]="SD = 1"
for (i in 1:length(spread)){
	lines(x, dnorm(x,sd=spread[i]), lwd=1, col=colors[i])
} 
legend("topright", inset=.05, title="Distributions",
  labels, lwd=2, lty=c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2), col=colors[c(1:3,5)])

```


# Skew/ Asymetry
- Skewness is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of symmetry. 
- A distribution, or data set, is symmetric 
    - if it looks the same to the left and right of the center point.

- Refers to the tail of the distribution
- Positively skewed (right skewed)
    - Bulk of the mass is on the left

-	Negatively skewed (left skewed)
    - Bulk of the mass is on the right
  
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("res/pic/skew.gif")
```


# Kurtosis – peakedness

- Kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are 
    - heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. 
- Data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails, or outliers. 
- Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have light tails, or lack of outliers. 
    - A uniform (flat) distribution  would be the extreme case.

# Kurtosis – peakedness
- Low k
    - Leptokurtic
- Normal
    - Mesokurtic
- High k
    - Platykurtic

```{r}

# Specific Measures

- Measures of Central Tendency
    - Mean
    - Median
    - Mode
    

# Central tendency: Mean

- Mean ($\mu$; $\bar{X}$)
    - arithmetic average
    - $\bar{X}$ is used for samples
    - Mu ($\mu$) is used for population

$\bar{X}= \frac{1}{n}  \sum^{n}_{i=1}x_{i}$


# Central tendency: Mean
- Properties
    - Is the balance point of the distribution (in terms of center of mass) $\sum^{n}_{i=1}(x_{i}-\bar{x})=0$
    - Least squares property
        - The sum of squared deviations about the mean is small 
    - highly sensitive to outliers (extreme scores)
        - (weakness; it means that the mean is not so good as a measure of central tendency in highly skewed distributions)
        - Is not a robust statistic (low robust = sensitive to outliers; high robust = not sensitive to outliers)
        
# Central tendency: Mean
- Very good with quantitative data (interval and ratio data, 
    - especially bell shaped distributions)
    - Very popular statistic


```{r mean,echo=TRUE}
library(pscl)
data(prussian)

#horse kick fatalities by year
prussian$y

variable<-prussian$y 

# Mean
mean(variable)

```



# Central Tendency: Median
- Median (Md)
- Def: central score in a distribution
    - If *n is odd* then 
        - Med = value of the $\frac{n+1}{2}$ item term.
        
    - If *n is even* then 
        - Med = average of the $\frac{n+}{2}$  and $\frac{n+1}{2}$ item terms.
        
# Central Tendency: Median
- Properties
    - Balance point of scores
    - Highly robust to outliers (less sensitive than the mean to outliers)
    - Sum of absolute deviations is smaller than any other constant (c)
        $\sum^{n}_{i=1}(\left|X-c\right|)$
        
- Often used for ordinal data

```{r median,echo=TRUE}

#Median
median(variable)

# By hand

# Sample Size?
(sample.size=length(variable))

# Even or Odd
## Test if number is divisible by 2.
## If yes, then even
## Else, is odd
sample.size %% 2 == 0 

# Sort our values
variable=sort(variable)

# if odd, grab the midpoint value sample size / 2

variable[sample.size/2]


# if even grab the average of the midpoint values sample size / 2  and sample size+1 / 2

(variable[sample.size/2] + variable[1+sample.size/2])/2


```


# Central Tendency: Mode
- Mode: most common score
- Local modes are the highest point with a subset of the distribution, there can be multiple ones

```{r mode,echo=TRUE}
#Mode
mode(variable) # That's not mode!

# Function to examine mode
Mode <- function(x) {
	ux <- unique(x)   #finds all unique values
	ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))] #returns the value which is most frequent
}
Mode(variable)
```

# Relationship between mean, median, and mode
- When we have a symmetric unimodal distribution
    - Mean=median=mode

- positively skewed
    - mode < median < mean
- negatively skewed
    - mean < median < mode
    
```{r}

```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
## summary
hist(variable)
library(Hmisc)
describe(variable)
```


# Measures of Spread around the Median

- Range
    - maximum value - minimum value
    - $max(x_{i})-min(x_{i})$
    - Non-robust to outliers
    
- Quartiles
    - Lower quartile (Q1), 25th percentile
    - Second quartile (Q2), 50th percentile / median
    - Upper quartile (Q3), 75th percentile

- Interquartile Range (IQR)
    - Q3-Q1
    - Sometimes called h-spread; h = hinges

# R Examples
```{r,echo=TRUE}
# Range
range(variable)
max(variable) -min(variable)

# 5 Number Summary / Quartiles
summary(variable)

```

# Spread around the Mean
- Variance ($\sigma^{2}$;$s^{2}$)
    - Measure of spread around the mean
    - Goal of the measure to use every score
    
    $\sigma^{2}$ = $\frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}(x_{i}-\mu)^{2}}{N}$
    
    $s^{2}$ = $\frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}(x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}}{n-1}$


- Standard Deviation ($\sigma$;s)
    - $\sigma$ = $\sqrt{\sigma^{2}}$
    - s = $\sqrt{s^{2}}$
    
# Bessel's Correction
- $s^{2}$ is nearly the average squared deviation

- $s^{2}$ uses n-1 instead of N
    - Otherwise we get biased estimates
    - This adjustment is called Bessel's correction
- In our formula, we are using the sample mean (x) instead of the true mean ($\mu$)
    - this results in underestimating each $x_{i} − \mu$ by $x − \mu$. 

- Properties
    - Std is in raw score units
    - Both the variance and standard deviation are highly NOT robust

# R Examples

```{r,echo=TRUE}
# Variance
var(variable)

# Standard Deviation
sqrt(var(variable))
sd(variable)
```
