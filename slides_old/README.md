# Slides

This outline is a work in progress.

## Outline

The course is divided into three parts. Part 1 is on exploratory data analysis, part 2 is making rigorous conclusions via statistical tools like modeling and inference, and part 3 includes topics that are designed to inspire students to learn more data science and statistics.

### Part 1: Exploring data

- p1_d01: Welcome to Data Science
- p1_d02: Introduction to R/RStudio + git/GitHub
- p1_d03: Fundamentals of data + data visualization
- p1_d04: Tidy data + data wrangling
- p1_d05: Types of variables
- p1_d06: Recoding and transforming variables
- p1_d07: Data Visualization and Exploration, Pt 1
- p1_d08: Data Visualization and Exploration, Pt 2
- p1_d09: Visualizing data over time and space
- p1_d10: Confounding variables and Simpson's paradox
- p1_d11: Case studies: SAT scores and smoking

### Part 2: Making rigorous conclusions

- p2_d01: The language of models
- p2_d02: Formalizing linear models
- p2_d03: Multiple linear regression
- p2_d04: Model selection
- p2_d05: Case study: Model selection for Paris Paintings
- p2_d06: Prediction and model validation
- p2_d07: Estimation via bootstrapping
- p2_d08: Hypothesis testing via simulation methods
- p2_d09: Inference overview
- p2_d10: Inference for regression
- p2_d11: Central Limit Theorem and CLT based inference
- p2_d12: Case study: Inferring from the General Social Survey

### Part 3: Looking forward

- p3_d01: Web scraping
- p3_d02: Functions and automation
- p3_d03: Interactive visualizations with Shiny
- p3_d04: Bayesian inference

## Toolkit

Slides are built in using the **xaringan** package. See [here](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) for more info on xaringan. There are two main reasons for choosing this format:

1. `xaringan` slides are R Markdown based, meaning code, output, and narrative can all live in one place and compiling the slides will run the R code as well.
2. Slide output is mobile friendly.

### Instructions

- Each slide deck is in its own folder, and one level above there is a custom css file. To compile the slides use `xaringan::inf_mr(cast_from = "..")`. This will launch the slides in the Viewer, and it will get updated as you edit and save your work.
