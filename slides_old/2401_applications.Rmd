# Test 3 Results

```{r testdata,include=FALSE}

```

- Scores were similar to other tests

```{r test,echo=TRUE}
df=results_percent
mean(df$test3_percent)
median(df$test3_percent)
max(df$test3_percent)
```

***
- The distributions across tests were similar

```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
df=results_long

mu <- ddply(df, "test", summarise, grp.median=median(percent))
#head(mu)
p <- ggplot(df, 
             aes(x=percent,color=test))
p + geom_density(alpha=.5,
             aes(fill=test)) +
    geom_vline(data=mu, 
             aes(xintercept=grp.median, color=test),
             linetype="dashed") + 
    scale_color_brewer(
             palette="Dark2") + theme_minimal()
```


***
- The correlations across tests were moderately high.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(corrplot)
cor_results=cor(results_percent,method = "spearman")
corrplot.mixed(cor_results, lower = "ellipse", upper = "number")
```

***
- Tests 1 and 2 explain a moderate amount of variability in Test 3

```{r,echo=TRUE}
# Test 3 predicted from tests 1 and 2
lm3_12=lm(data=results_percent, 
          test3_percent~test1_percent+test2_percent)

# Test 3 predicted from test 1
lm3_1=lm(data=results_percent, 
         test3_percent~test1_percent)

# Test 3 predicted from test 2
lm3_2=lm(data=results_percent, 
         test3_percent~test2_percent)

# Can we precict test 3 grades from tests 1 and 2
summary(lm3_12)

# Do we need both tests?
print(anova(lm3_12,lm3_1))

```



# Applications

- Throughout this course, we have dabbled in R while covering the foundations of statistics

- For the next two weeks, I'm going to focus on using R to answer statistical questions.

- Accordingly, I'd like your thoughts on an alternative final exam.
    - Would you all be interested in a take-home exam, instead of an in-class exam?
    - I'd give it to you at the end of the last day of class, 
        - and you'd have until Friday, December 14 Noon.
    
# In the beginning...

- We discussed the Steps in a Research Study
    - Question
    - Design
    - Sampling
    - Measurement
    - Summary
    
# Question
- Research Problem
- Specific Research Question
- Operationalize
- Hypothesize

# Research Problem
- Although we can pick anything...
- In my experience, you want to pick a broad area where you have:
    - you have some interest; 
    - background knowledge
        - (Or can obtain some. 
        - Wikipedia is actually a good place to start.
            - Look at the references); and
    - data
        - either you collect your own, or
        - you find pre-existing data
        
# Specific Research Question
- Begin by asking several questions about a topic. 
- Eliminate questions that cannot be answered by direct observation or by gathering evidence. 
- Break broad questions into smaller questions that can be investigated one at a time. 

# Characteristics of a good research question:
- The question is feasible.
- The question is clear.
- The question is meaningful.
- The question is ethical.

# General Structure of a specific question.
- What is the relationship between X and Y?
- What Xs influence Y?
- What is the effect of X on Y?

# Operationalize
- Operationalization is a process of defining the fuzzy concepts; and 
- making the concept(s)
    - distinguishable, 
    - measurable, and 
    - understandable in terms of observable data.
    
***
- If you collect your own data, 
    - then operationalizing is fairly straightforward.
    
- Identify which measures are used in topic area
    - Are those measures reliable?
    - Are those measures valid?
    - Are there population norms?
    
- Practical Considerations...
    - How much time does the subject need to take the test?
    - More time increases cost
        - participant time (paid hourly)
        - participant fatigue (lower quality data)
    - If you have a fixed amount of time,
        - then you have to remove other questions

***
- If you are going to use a public dataset,
    - then you're limited by what data are available to you.
- In that case, you'll have to look at what data are available and perhaps select your dataset based on that.
- Practical Considerations
    - Someone may have already used that dataset to answer a similar question
    - Someone may be in the process of using that dataset to answer a similar question.

# Pre-existing Data
- University Archives
    - [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)
    - [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/)
- Governments (Federal Agencies, State, and Local)
    - [USA data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
    - [India data.gov](https://data.gov.in/)
    - [City of Nashville](https://data.nashville.gov/)
    - [State of Tennessee... in theory](https://www.tn.gov/opengov/)
    - [State of Tennessee... in practice](http://tn-tnmap.opendata.arcgis.com/)
- Other Organizations
    - [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/opendata/)
    
# Data Structure Varies
How the data are organized varies a lot

- Some data will be pre-packaged in R

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(datasets)
#library(help = "datasets")
ls("package:datasets")

library(ggplot2movies)
#library(help = "ggplot2movies")
ls("package:ggplot2movies")
```

***

- Some will have online GUIs, where you can select your variables and generate an R file for you
    - [nlsinfo](https://www.nlsinfo.org/) from the BLS
