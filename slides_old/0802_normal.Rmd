# Normal Distribution

Def: a particular bell-shaped curve that has the following mathematical properties

$f(x)= \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^{2}}$

- Formula has two parameters
    - $\mu$
    - $\sigma$

- The standard normal ($\mu=0$; $\sigma=1$) simplifies the equation





# Plots of the Standard Normal with multiple means

- The mean is located at the center of the symmetric curve and is the same as the median. 
- Changing $\mu$ without changing $\sigma$ moves the Normal curve along the horizontal axis without changing its variability.

```{r}
#### Normal Distribution

# Display the normal distributions with various means

x <- seq(-80, 80, length=1000)
hx <- dnorm(x)
colors <- c("red", "blue","green", "green", "gold", "black")

plot(x, hx, type="l", lty=2, xlab="x value",
		 ylab="Density", main="Comparison of normal Distributions",xlim=c(-5, 7))
location<-c(2,4,-2)
for (i in 1:3){
	lines(x, dnorm(x,mean=location[i]), lwd=1, col=colors[i])
}

```

# Plots of the Standard Normal with multiple standard deviations

- The standard deviation $\sigma$ controls the variability of a Normal curve. When the standard deviation is larger, the area under the normal curve is less concentrated about the mean.

- The standard deviation is the distance from the center to the change-of-curvature points on either side.

```{r}
# Display the normal distributions with various standard deviations
plot(x, hx, type="l", lty=2, xlab="x value",
		 ylab="Density", main="Comparison of normal Distributions",xlim=c(-10, 10))

for (i in c(.5,2,4,6)){
	lines(x, dnorm(x,sd=i), lwd=1, col=colors[i])
}

```


# Normal Distribution

- In the Normal distribution, with mean $\mu$  and standard deviation $\sigma$:
    - approximately 68\% of the observations fall within 1 $\sigma$ of $\mu$
    - approximately 95\% of the observations fall within 2 $\sigma$ of $\mu$
    - approximately 99.7\% of the observations fall within 3 $\sigma$ of $\mu$

- This property is sometimes called: The 68-95-99.7 Rule

# Worked Example

- The distribution of Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) vocabulary scores for seventh-grade students in Gary, Indiana, is close to Normal. 

- Suppose the distribution is N(6.84, 1.55).

- Sketch the Normal density curve for this distribution.

- What percent of ITBS scores is between 3.74 and 9.94?

- What percent of the scores is above 5.29?

# Standard Normal

- Normal is a model of the real world
- Not exact, but it is a facile model for many things
    - Physical features
    - Psychological features
    - Performance measures
    - Not all variables are normal
        - Skewed variables (e.g. income)
        - Any count variable (number of kids, mistakes on an exam)

# Real World Data

- Many variables follow this distribution ( but not all)
- I have plotted histograms of data,
    - we have already used in this class
    - overlaid with the standard normal.
 
```{r example,echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(HistData)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(Galton, aes(x = child)) + 
	geom_histogram(fill = "red") + 
	stat_function(
		fun = function(x, mean, sd, n){
			n * dnorm(x = x, mean = mean, sd = sd)
		}, 
		args = with(Galton, c(mean = mean(child), sd = sd(child), n
= length(child)))
	) + 
	scale_x_continuous("Heights of Children") 

```
 
    
# Height of Children (Galton dataset)
```{r galton,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(HistData)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(Galton, aes(x = child)) + 
	geom_histogram(fill = "red") + 
	stat_function(
		fun = function(x, mean, sd, n){
			n * dnorm(x = x, mean = mean, sd = sd)
		}, 
		args = with(Galton, c(mean = mean(child), sd = sd(child), n
= length(child)))
	) + 
	scale_x_continuous("Heights of Children") 

```


# IMBD movie ratings (movies dataset)
```{r movies,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2movies)
data(movies)

plotted_dataset=movies
plotted_dataset$variablex=movies$rating
variablex=movies$rating

ggplot(plotted_dataset, aes(x =variablex)) + 
	geom_histogram(fill = "red") +
	geom_freqpoly(aes(x=rnorm(length(plotted_dataset$variablex))*sd(plotted_dataset$variablex)+mean(plotted_dataset$variablex)),fill = "black")  +
	scale_x_continuous("IMBD Movie Ratings")  


```

# Temperature in Nottingham (nottem dataset)

```{r nottem,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)

plotted_dataset=as.data.frame(nottem)
plotted_dataset$variablex=nottem
ggplot(plotted_dataset, aes(x =variablex)) + 
	geom_histogram(fill = "red") + 
	stat_function(
		fun = function(x, mean, sd, n){
			n * dnorm(x = x, mean = mean, sd = sd)
		}, 
		args = with(plotted_dataset, c(mean = mean(variablex), sd = sd(variablex), n

	) + 
	scale_x_continuous("Temperature in Nottingham")

# Standard Normal
- Normal distribution tricks
    - Symmetric
    - 50% of area above zero
    - Total proportion is 1.0 (or 100%)
    
# Area under the Normal Distribution

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("res/pic/normal.png")
```


# Rescaling

- All Normal distributions are the same if we measure in units of size $\sigma$ from the mean $\mu$ as center.

- We can convert any variable into the same metric as the standard normal

- Changing to these units is called standardizing  or rescaling.



# Converting Formulas

- Statistics Sample
- $z_{i}$ = $\frac{x_{i}-\bar{x}}{s}$

- Population
- $z_{i}$ = $\frac{x_{i}-\mu}{\sigma}$

# Merits
- Advantages
    - Allows us to compare scores on a common metric 
    - Origin is 0. The mean
        - The units are 1, the standard deviation
        - + values above the mean
        - - values below the mean
   
- We can compare across measurement scales
    - Shape of the distribution does NOT CHANGE
- We can go from z-scores to raw scores

```{r,echo=TRUE}

library(ggplot2movies)
################ Rescaling
variable<-movies$rating
scale(variable)[1:10]

plot(density(variable)) # no scaling
plot(density(scale(variable))) # with scaling

```


# Worked Z-Score Problem

- Here are the IQ test scores of 31 7th-grade girls in a Midwest school district. 
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("res/pic/iqz.png")
```

# Worked Z-Score Problem
A) We expect IQ scores to be approximately Normal. Make a stem plot to check that there are no major departures from normality.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("res/pic/iqstem.png")
```

# Worked Z-Score Problem
B) Find the mean and standard deviation
- Mean =105.84 = $\sum \frac{X_{i}}{n}$ = 3281/31
- SD = 14.27 =  $s^{2}$ = $\frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}(x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}}{n-1}$ =  $s^{2}$ = $\frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}(x_{i}-105.84)^{2}}{30}$

# Worked Z-Score Problem
B) What proportion of scores are within one standard deviation of the mean?

- One SD above mean = 105.84+14.27 = 120.11
- One SD below mean = 105.84 -14.27 = 91.57

- 23/31 = .74
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("res/pic/workz.png")
```


# Worked Z-score Problem

B) What proportion of scores are within TWO standard deviations of the mean?

- TWO SD above mean = 105.84+2(14.27) = 134.38
- TWO SD below mean = 105.84 - 2(14.27) = 77.3
- 29/31 = .935

# Worked Z-score Problem
B) What would these proportions be in an exactly Normal distribution?
-  +/- One SD
