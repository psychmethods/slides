# Bivariate 
- So far, we have been analyzing summary statistics that describe aspects of a single list of numbers
- Frequently, however, we are interested in how variables behave together
    - Measuring the relationship (correlation)
    - Modeling the relationship (regression)

# Motivating Example
- Smoking and Lung Capacity
    - Suppose, for example, we wanted to investigate the relationship between cigarette smoking and lung capacity
    - We might ask a group of people about their smoking habits, and measure their lung capacities

# Smoking and Lung Capacity
```{r smoking_table}
library(knitr);library(kableExtra);library(dplyr)
# Create Data Frame
smoking=data.frame(cigarettes=c(0,5,10,15,20),lung_capacity=c(45,42,33,31,29))

kable(smoking)%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

# Visualizing

- With R or any other statistics software, we can produce a scatterplot, like this one.

```{r,echo=T}
plot(smoking)
```

# Or this one

- A scatterplot shows the relationship between two quantitative variables that are measured on the same individuals. 
    - The values of one variable appear on the horizontal axis, 
    - and the values of the other variable appear on the vertical axis. 
    - Each individual in the data appears as the point in the plot fixed by the values of both variables for that individual.

```{r,echo=T}
library(car)
scatterplot(lung_capacity~cigarettes,data=smoking)
```

# Or this one

- Always plot the explanatory variable, if there is one, on the horizontal axis (the x-axis) of a scatterplot
    - if there is no explanatory-response distinction, either variable can go on the horizontal axis.

```{r,echo=T}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggExtra)

# classic plot :
p=ggplot(smoking, aes(x=cigarettes, y=lung_capacity, color=cigarettes, size=cigarettes)) +
      geom_point() +
      theme(legend.position="none")
p
```

# Or this one
- We can see from the graph that as smoking goes up, lung capacity tends to go down.
```{r hist,echo=T}

# with marginal histogram
ggMarginal(p, type="histogram")
```

# Or this one

- Here, the two variables covary in opposite directions. 
- This is a negative relationship
```{r density,echo=T} 
# marginal density
ggMarginal(p, type="density")
```


# Scatter Plots

- In any graph of data, look for the overall pattern and for striking deviations from that pattern.
- You can describe the overall pattern of a scatterplot by the 
    - direction (positive or negative), 
    - form, and 
    - strength of the relationship.

```{r boxplot,echo=T} 
# marginal boxplot
ggMarginal(p, type="boxplot")
```

- More examples  https://www.statmethods.net/graphs/scatterplot.html


# Direction of Association
- Two variables are *positively associated* when above-average values of one tend to accompany above-average values of the other, and below-average values also tend to occur together.

- Two variables are *negatively associated* when above-average values of one tend to accompany below-average values of the other, and vice versa.


# Strength of the Relationship

- We now examine two statistics: 
  - covariance and 
  - correlation, for quantifying how variables covary.


# Covariance
- Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables vary together.
- When two variables covary in opposite directions, as smoking and lung capacity do, 
    - values tend to be on opposite sides of the group mean.  
    - That is, when smoking is above its group mean, 
    - lung capacity tends to be below its group mean.
- Consequently, by averaging the product of deviation scores, we can obtain a measure of how the variables vary together.


# Sample Covariance

- Sample covariance between X and Y is an estimate of that average (cross-) product of deviation scores in the population

$s_{x,y}=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}(x_{i}-\bar{x})(y_{i}-\bar{y})$

- A more computationally convenient formula:

$s_{x,y}=\frac{1}{n-1}(\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}x_{i}y_{i}-\frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}x_{i}\sum^{n}_{i=1}y_{i}}{n})$

- Useful fact: the variance of a variable is its covariance with itself. 

$s^{2}=s_{x,x}=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}((x_{i}-\bar{x})(x_{i}-\bar{x}))$

# Computing Covariance
- If we wanted to compute the covariance for smoking and lung capacity, we can save ourselves some heartache.
- Rather than finding each deviation from the mean for x and y

```{r,echo=T}
covariance_calc=data.frame(X=smoking$cigarettes,Y=smoking$lung_capacity)

# find x_i-x_bar
covariance_calc$dx=covariance_calc$X-mean(covariance_calc$X)

# find y_i-y_bar
covariance_calc$dy=covariance_calc$Y-mean(covariance_calc$Y)
```

- and then finding their product

```{r,echo=T}
#cross multiply x deviations and y deviations
covariance_calc$dxdy=covariance_calc$dy*covariance_calc$dx

# cross multi X and Y
covariance_calc$xy=covariance_calc$Y*covariance_calc$X

```

- Giving these values

```{r}
kable(covariance_calc)
```

- We'd then sum the dXdY column and get `r sum(covariance_calc$dxdy)`, and we then compute the covariance as: 


$s_{x,y}=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}(x_{i}-\bar{x})(y_{i}-\bar{y})= \frac{-215}{5-1}=-53.75$

# Alternative Computation

- We can compute $\sum x=50$, $\sum y=180$, $\sum xy=1585$, and n, and use that easier equation

$s_{x,y}=\frac{1}{n-1}(\sum x_{i}y_{i}-\frac{\sum x_{i}\sum y_{i}}{n})$

$=\frac{1}{5-1}(1585-\frac{50\times180}{5})$

$=\frac{1}{4}(1585-\frac{9000}{5})$

$=\frac{1}{4}(1585-1800)$

$=\frac{1}{4}(-215)$

$=-53.75$

# Covariance in R

```{r,echo=T}
cov(smoking)

cov(smoking)[1,2]

var(smoking$cigarettes)
```

# Covariance

- Although covariance is an extremely important concept and is the cornerstone of many advanced methods (ANOVA, ANCOVA, SEM, regression, etc)
- it has interpretation problems just like variance
- it isn't in a meaningful scale
- it tells us whether a relationship is positive or negative
    - but not much more than that.
    
# Covariance Scaling
- is `r cov(smoking)[1,2]` a strong relationship? 
    - it depends on the scale
- If we convert cigarettes into packs, the relationship hasn't changed.
- but the covariance has...

```{r,echo=T}

smoking$packs=smoking$cigarettes/20

cov(smoking$packs,smoking$lung_capacity)
```

- The value is, in a sense, "polluted by the metric of the numbers."
- Depending on the scale of the data, the absolute value of the covariance can be very large or very small

# Standardizing Covariance
- We can take the scale out of the covariance.
- What happens if we use z-scores instead of raw deviations?
- Remember, that z-scores are also a measure of deviations
- This is called the (Pearson) Correlation Coefficient


# Correlation Coefficient
- The sample correlation is the sum of cross-products of z-scores divided by n-1:

$r_{x,y}=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}(Z_{x_{i}}\times Z_{y_{i}})$

- The sample correlation is the sum of cross-products of z-scores divided by n:

$\rho_{x,y}=\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}(Z_{x_{i}}\times Z_{y_{i}})$

# Formulae for Correlation

- We can think of a correlation coefficient as a covariance with
the standard deviations factored out:

$r_{x,y}=\frac{s_{x,y}}{s_{x}\times s_{y}}$

- we can think of covariance as a correlation with the standard deviations put back in.

$s_{x,y}=r_{x,y}s_{x}s_{y}$

# Properties of r
- Notation
    - Sample Statistic r
    - Population Parameter $\rho$
        - pronounced row, but spelt rho
- Transformation
    - r is the same regardless of how the values are measured. 
    - Height in inches and centemeters lead to the same r


```{r plot,echo=T}
if (!require("HistData")) install.packages("HistData") ## Installs library if missing

cor(child,parent)
detach(Galton_cm)			# Remember to detach you dataset!

grid.arrange(plotin, plotcm, top='Correlation between Parent and Child Heights in inches and centimeters')

```
    
# Properties of r
- r ranges from -1 to 1 [-1,1]
    - |r| indicates the size of the relationship
    - r>0 indicates positive relationship (0,1]
    - r<0 indicates negative relationship [-1,0)
    - r is symmetric
        - $r_{x,y}=r_{y,x}$

# Correlation Interpretation

- Perfect
    - Exactly –1. A perfect downhill (negative) linear relationship
    - Exactly +1. A perfect uphill (positive) linear relationship
- Strong
    - -0.70. A strong downhill (negative) linear relationship
    - +0.70. A strong uphill (positive) linear relationship
- Moderate
    - –0.50. A moderate downhill (negative) relationship
    - +0.50. A moderate uphill (positive) relationship
- Small
    - –0.30. A small downhill (negative) linear relationship
    - +0.30. A small uphill (positive) linear relationship

# Linear Relationship 

- The correlation quantifies the linear association. 

- If your data aren't linear, then the correlation can be misleading.

- If your data have outliers, then the correlation can be misleading.

- Anscombe's Quartet comprises four datasets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics, yet appear very different when graphed. 

- These data were constructed in 1973 by the statistician Francis @Anscombe1973 . 

- Demonstrates the importance of graphing data before analyzing it and the effect of outliers on statistical properties. 

- It's intended to counter the impression among statisticians that "numerical calculations are exact, but graphs are rough."

# Correlation Cautions

- Correlation requires that both variables be quantitative, so it makes sense to do the arithmetic indicated by the formula for r𝑟.
- Correlation does not describe curved relationships between variables, no matter how strong the relationship is between them.
- Correlation is strongly affected by a few outlying observations.

- Correlation is not a complete summary of two-variable data.


# More Correlation Cautions

- Restriction of Range.
- Results in r to go down artificially
    - r -> $\rho$
- Combined groups can hid the relationships, when groups have different relationships
    - Simpson’s Paradox

# Final Comments

- The correlation Coefficient is neither robust nor resistant.
    - Not robust because strong nonlinear relationships between the two variables may not be recognized.
    - Not resistant because it is sensitive to outlying points.
    - It is the most sensitive summary stat we have seen thus far

# Shared Variance: $R^{2}$
- How much do those correlated variables have in common?
[http://rpsychologist.com/d3/correlation/](http://rpsychologist.com/d3/correlation/)
- Common variance
    - i.e. Shared Variance
- Coefficient of Determination
    - % variability between the two variables that has been accounted for 
    - the remaining 1-$R^{2}$ of the variability is still unaccounted for
