# Normal Distribution

---

## Normal Distribution

Def: a particular bell-shaped curve that has the following mathematical properties

$f(x)= \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^{2}}$

- Formula has two parameters
    - $\mu$
    - $\sigma$
- The standard normal $(\mu=0; \sigma=1)$ simplifies the equation

---

# Standard Normal with multiple means

- The mean is located at the center of the symmetric curve and is the same as the median. 
- Changing $\mu$ without changing $\sigma$ moves the Normal curve along the horizontal axis without changing its variability.

- The standard deviation $\sigma$ controls the variability of a Normal curve. 
- When the standard deviation is larger, the area under the normal curve is less concentrated about the mean.
- The standard deviation is the distance from the center to the change-of-curvature points on either side.

# Normal Distribution

.pull-left[
- In the Normal distribution, with mean $\mu$  and standard deviation $\sigma$:
    - approximately $68\%$ of the observations fall within 1 $\sigma$ of $\mu$
    - approximately $95\%$ of the observations fall within 2 $\sigma$ of $\mu$
    - approximately $99.7\%$ of the observations fall within 3 $\sigma$ of $\mu$
- This property is sometimes called: The `68-95-99.7 Rule`

# Standard Normal

- Normal is a model of the real world
- Not exact, but it is a facile model for many things
    - Physical features
    - Psychological features
    - Performance measures
--
    - Not all variables are normal
        - Skewed variables (e.g. income)
        - Any count variable (number of kids, mistakes on an exam)
---

# Real World Data
.pull-left[
- Many variables follow this distribution ( but not all)
- I have plotted histograms of data,
    - we have already used in this class
    - overlaid with the standard normal.

# Rescaling

---

# Rescaling

- All Normal distributions are the same 
  - if we measure in units of size $\sigma$ from the mean $\mu$ as center.
- We can convert any variable into the same metric as the standard normal
- Changing to these units is called standardizing or rescaling.


---

# Converting Formulas

.pull-left[
- Statistics Sample
- $z_{i}$ = $\frac{x_{i}-\bar{x}}{s}$
]

--
.pull-right[
- Population
- $z_{i}$ = $\frac{x_{i}-\mu}{\sigma}$
]

---

# Merits
.pull-left[
- Advantages
    - Allows us to compare scores on a common metric 
    - Origin is 0. The mean
        - The units are 1, the standard deviation
        - '+' values above the mean
        - '-' values below the mean
]

--

.pull-right[
- We can compare across measurement scales
    - Shape of the distribution does NOT CHANGE
- We can go from z-scores to raw scores
]

---

# Demo

.pull-left[
.small[
```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2movies)

# Raw data
movies$rating[1:10]
# Rescaling
variable <- movies$rating
scale(variable)[1:10]
```
]

- Mean = `r round(mean(variable,na.rm = TRUE),digits=2)` (SD  = `r round(sd(variable,na.rm = TRUE),digits=2)`)
]

--

.pull-right[

.midi[
```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
#create a table to show the first 10 raw scores and their z-scores
data.frame(Raw = variable[1:10], Z_Score = round(scale(variable)[1:10],digits=2)) %>%
  kable()

```

# Worked Z-Score Problem

- Here are the IQ test scores of 31 7th-grade girls in a Midwest school district. 
<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/iqz.png")
```

---
# Worked Z-Score Problem

A) We expect IQ scores to be approximately Normal.
--

- Make a stem plot to check that there are no major departures from normality.

--

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = "65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/iqstem.png")
```
---

# Worked Z-Score Problem

B) Find the mean and standard deviation
--

- Mean =105.84 = $\sum \frac{X_{i}}{n}$ = 3281/31
- SD = 14.27 =  $s^{2}$ = $\frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}(x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}}{n-1}$ =  $s^{2}$ = $\frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}(x_{i}-105.84)^{2}}{30}$

---

# Worked Z-Score Problem

C) What proportion of scores are within one standard deviation of the mean?
- One SD above mean = 105.84 + 14.27 = 120.11
- One SD below mean = 105.84 - 14.27 = 91.57
- 23/31 = `r round(23/31,digits=2)`
--

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = "65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/workz.png")
```

---
# Worked Z-score Problem

B) What proportion of scores are within TWO standard deviations of the mean?
- TWO SD above mean = 105.84 + 2*(14.27) = 134.38
- TWO SD below mean = 105.84 - 2*(14.27) = 77.3
- 29/31 = `r round(29/31,digits=3)`

---

# Worked Z-score Problem

B) What would these proportions be in an exactly Normal distribution?

-  +/- One SD?
